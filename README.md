# PDFDataExtractor
A simple python script which extracts text and word use data from your PDF file. It also exports all the pages as .png images.

It uses several libraries such as pandas, numpy, pypdf and such. All instructions are in the .py file in the comments.

In the project files, in the "test" folder, there is a free book called "Python for Everybody" by Dr. Charles R. Severance. It is a completely free book anyone can get online. It is included solely for the purpose of being able to test if the program is configured correctly on the local machine and if everything works before beginning to work on something important with it.
